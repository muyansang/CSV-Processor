## Verification questions

1. Run your `CsvJoin` application with program arguments so that it attempts to join
   `tests/testCsvToList/non-rectangular.csv` (on the left) with `tests/testCsvToList/empty-col.csv`
   (on the right).  What **red text** does your program print to IntelliJ's console?
   (as a reminder, it had better not include a stack trace)

   Answer: Error: Input table not rectangular

## Reflection questions

1. Which `LinkedSeq` operation did you think was the most difficult to implement and debug?  What
   corner case caught you by surprise or was particularly awkward to handle?  Finally, describe a
   testing scenario that you added which covers this corner case.

   Answer: In terms of complexity, remove is the relatively most difficult because this is the one I spent most time
   debugging. Unlike insert before, we don't have to encounter the condition whether sucessor is in the linked sequal.
   In remove, we have to acount different scenario such as whether if the removing elements exist, removing the last,
   or first given the looping algorithm. It is very easy to miss some edge cases so I debugged couple times for this
   function as I implementing test driven programming.

2. How did you plan and budget your time so that you could complete and debug your application by
   the deadline?  If you worked as partners, how did you coordinate to ensure in advance that you
   would have sufficient time to work on the project together?

   We have a consensus between me and my partner that we will finish all tasks, implement and any new things one day
   before the hard deadline. So that we got a least one day to finalize and check if there were any issues with our code
   such as adding more possible test cases just to make sure our program can run.
